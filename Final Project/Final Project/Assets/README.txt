[] Gameplay []

Control your ship to dodge around asteroids and enemy projectiles.
Destroy asteroids and enemy ships to gain points.
Enemy lasers deal 1 damage, lose all health and you explode!
Colliding with any obstacle is instant death!

There are 4 different colors of enemy ships, each being different.
[Red]    Standard Enemy
[Blue]   Slower speed and firing, but a much faster projectile
[Yellow] Faster speed and firing
[Purple] Regular speeds, with a total of 3 health points

Destroy asteroids for a chance of 1 of 2 power ups.
[Health Restore] Restores 1 HP, does nothing if full HP
[Power Up] Increase the speed and fire rate of your ship for 5 seconds, restarts timer if grabbed again while active

As the game time progresses, so does the difficulty.
With each new level of difficulty, more obstacles and enemies appear.
However, as the difficulty increases, there will be more enemies and less asteroids.
To compensate, asteroids will have a greater chance of dropping power ups with higher difficulties.

Dodge, shoot, and get as many points as you can.
